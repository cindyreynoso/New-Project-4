          <h2>What regions are major depression and bipolar disorder more common?</h2>
          <p>
            These charts report experience of depression or bipolar disorder over an adult lifetime. To preface, the datasource reports itâ€™s estimated that 1 in 3 women experience major depression in their lives. This does not chart diagnosis of these disorders.
            The Bipolar side of the chart reports that nearly 89% up to 100% of adults in Australasia and the Caribbean have experienced bipolar symptoms/episodes. Most other regions report much lower rates at less than 50% having experienced bipolar.
            The Major Depression side of the chart shows a different picture. 100% of adults in Australasia and the Caribbean reported experiencing Major Depression at some point. On this chart, across every area surveyed, Depression had a higher percent experience. This is not by a small margin either, there is a major disparity between the two. This means that experiences of depression, like seen in the previous chart, is something a large percentage of adults will experience at some point in their lifetime.

          <h2>What are some depressive symptoms across the USA?</h2>
          <p>
            This chart displays how common depression symptoms are, and how often they are. The chart has two major peaks at Low Energy and Psychomotor agitation. Whether experienced daily or often, these are the symptoms people suffer from the most. From this, we can decide that any depression treatment: whether medicine, change in routine, or therapy, should address these symptoms first. Also, these symptoms should be some of the first to look out for in someone suspected of going through depression
