          <p>
            According to the dataframe and chart, North America has the highest average mental health diagnosis rate across all time and disorders at 2.309. In comparison, South East Asia's average across time is 1.258. 
            North America also has the highest diagnosis rate at 5.9778 in anxiety disorders. In comparison, South Asia and SubSaharan Africa have the lowest diagnosis rates in eating disorders at 0.1239 and 0.1247. There is a large difference between the two diagnosis rates. 
            Overall, North America is the region with the highest rates of mental health diagnosis. 
            These comparisons are across all disorders, time, and grouped into regions. This is only a glance at aggregate data that will be further analyzed.
