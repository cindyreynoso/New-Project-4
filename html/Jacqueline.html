          <h2>Forward: Classifying Regions</h2>
          <p>
            Classifying 'regions' around the world is subjective. This map roughly outlines how countries were grouped into regions. These were done with liberties, such Australia being grouped with Oceania. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The regions are: North America, Central America (and the Caribbean), South America, Europe, the Middle East, SubSaharan Africa, South Asia, South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania.

          <h2>Do certain regions have higher rates of mental health percentages?</h2>
          <p>
            According to the dataframe and chart, North America has the highest average mental health diagnosis rate across all time and disorders at 2.309. In comparison, South East Asia's average across time is 1.258.  
          </p>
          <p>
            North America also has the highest diagnosis rate at 5.9778 in anxiety disorders. In comparison, South Asia and SubSaharan Africa have the lowest diagnosis rates in eating disorders at 0.1239 and 0.1247. There is a large difference between the two diagnosis rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, North America is the region with the highest rates of mental health diagnosis. 
          </p>
          <p>
            These comparisons are across all disorders, time, and grouped into regions. This is only a glance at aggregate data that will be further analyzed.

          <p>  
            This figure displays diagnosis rates across all regions. It shows that in every region, anxiety disorders and depression have the highest diagnosis rates compared to any other mental disorder. On the opposite end, eating disorders and schizophrenia have the lowest diagnosis rates.

            <p>
                How mental health is viewed, treated, and diagnosed has greatly changed over time. Factors impacting this include historical events (social, political, or economic), research, social attitudes, and best practices of that time.
                Thus, are there major fluctuations over time? Do diagnoses rates change over time?

                The first chart is an aggregate average diagnosis rate across the world. The lines look very flat, and appear to change very slightly. It does not appear very useful.

                This chart is a zoomed-in version of average diagnosis rate across the world for depression. With a closer look at the y-axis, fluctuations in diagnosis rates can be observed.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Statistics will naturally fluctuate over time, but do any show a large visual change? Charts for each disorder category across regions were produced.

                Diagnosis rates for depression fluctuate roughly +- 0.2 for each region. North America's line is roughly 0.6 the next highest region, and is roughly 1.5 above the lowest region Central America. This means across all regions, North America has the highest average depression rates.

            On this chart, East Asia has seen a large increase in alcohol use disorders at roughly 0.4 in a 25 year span. It seemed to steadly increase between 1990 and 2000, then between 2000 and 2010 saw a dramatic increase before flattening out again. This is a dramatic change compared to every other region. This means alcohol use disorders are becoming a big problem in East Asia.

            Most regions, besides North America, saw a marginal increase in schizophrenia diagnosis. As in the depression chart, North America has much higher diagnosis rates than any other region. However here, the disparity is much smaller with a 0.06 difference.

            Anxiety has the largest range in diagnosis rates of 2.5. The y-axis shows that even the lowest anxiety rates are above 3.0. This means anxiety disorders are a major issue across the world.

            Drug use disorders are highest in North America, with large increases between 1995 and 2000 and again between 2010 and 2015. The Middle East also is seeing a steady increase over time. Every other region has below 1.0 percent diagnosis rate and remains relatively consistent.

          <p>
            According to these charts, East Asia and North America have seen large visual changes in alcohol use and drug use respectively. What specifically caused this should be studied. As for treatment, these respective regions should work on addressing these major increases.

          <h2>Which five countries have the highest/lowest overall percent anxiety diagnosed compared to UN HDI? Is there a correlation?</h2>
          <p>
            The United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average human achievement based on: a long healthy life, being knowledgable, and having a decent standard of living. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The assumption here is that, if a country's HDI is high (meaning its citizens' needs are taken care of) then mental health issues might decrease. 
          </p>
          <p>
            However it appears the opposite is true. Countries with high HDI have higher mental health diagnosis rates. There are a few reasons why this may be caused. 
          </p>
          <p>
            1. With a low HDI, lack of knowledge also means lack of mental health services
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Countries with higher HDI also tend to have less 'cultural taboo' against mental health issues
          </p>
          <h2>Do certain regions have higher rates of specific mental health diagnoses? </h2>
          <p>
            Put simply, which regions have high and low rates of each disorder? Economy, government, culture, and religion all have different impacts on people, including their mental health.
          </p>
          <p>
            When looking at the previous charts, North America has some of the highest diagnoses of mental health issues over every other region. It also has a high HDI. Right below it, Central America has low mental health diagnosis and lower average HDIs. Perhaps Central American culture explains the difference. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As for alcohol use rates, Europe has the highest above any other region. European drinking culture may explain this (wine/pub cultures). SubSaharan Africa has the lowest, along with the Middle East. As most of the Middle East practices Islam, it is not unusual that alcohol use (which is considered haram or forbidden) is low. However, SubSaharan Africa with a much lower Muslim population has lower alcohol use disorder rates than the Middle East. What causes this is under speculation as the Middle East again has a higher HDI on average than SubSaharan Africa. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps SubSaharan Africa has such low rates across every chart is because it has a low HDI. Much of SubSaharan Africa are part of industrializing countries, which may not have the means more industrialized countries do to focus on mental health. Or there is a lack of research and resources for mental health in these areas.

            Does year (time) have an effect on overall mental health diagnosis?
          </p>
          <p>
            Study change over time by region or by country on an individual basis and cross reference with major events in the country/region. For example, anxiety diagnosis increasing or decreasing the US around major events such as 9/11, the 2008 economic crash, 2020 pandemic.

          <p>
            Which five countries have the highest/lowest overall percent anxiety diagnosed compared to UN HDI? Is there a correlation?
          </p>
          <p>
              Study with more data, UN's CSV had a UTF code error when reading it in. Study over time if correlation is consistent, only studied data from 2017. Study with more countries, rather than the top/bottom 10.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do certain regions have higher rates of specific mental health diagnoses?
          </p>
          <p>
            Use Hofstede's Cultural Dimension model to correlate aspects of culture (identity, power) to mental health.
